bio: "Brazilian developer. Game, music and technology lover.
  I'm a 2+ years developer. I love to study and learn new skills,
  exchange work and study experience with people around me and share my knowledge with the ones that want it. I work with Web and Mobile Development since 2016 with AngularJS and Ionic and with Spring.
  I started to work with React.js in July 2018, right now I'm only working with Frontend, but I have knowledge in Backend with Node.js and Spring.
  I like to work with both: Front-End and Back-End development. I work with many languages, frameworks and technologies. I really enjoy new challenges, do you have any?"
